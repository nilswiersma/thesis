  abstract = {Current trends in technology scaling foreshadow worsening transistor reliability as well as greater numbers of transistors in each system. The combination of these factors will soon make long-term product reliability extremely difficult in complex modern systems such as systems on a chip (SoC) and chip multiprocessor (CMP) designs, where even a single device failure can cause fatal system errors. Resiliency to device failure will be a necessary condition at future technology nodes. In this work, we present a network-on-chip (NoC) routing algorithm to boost the robustness in interconnect networks, by reconfiguring them to avoid faulty components while maintaining connectivity and correct operation. This distributed algorithm can be implemented in hardware with less than 300 gates per network router. Experimental results over a broad range of 2D-mesh and 2D-torus networks demonstrate 99.99\% reliability on average when 10\% of the interconnect links have failed.},

  abstract = {Safety-relevant systems in the automotive domain often implement features such as lockstep execution for error detection, and reset and re-execution for error correction. Light-lockstep has already been adopted in some such systems due to its relatively low-implementation cost given that it does not require deep changes into nonlockstep hardware. Instead, as only off-core activities (i.e., data/addresses sent) need to be compared across different cores, light-lockstep designs are lowly intrusive. This approach has been proven sufficient to guarantee functional correctness of the system in the presence of errors in the cores, in particular in relation with certification against safety standards such as ISO26262 in the automotive domain. However, error detection in light-lockstep systems may occur long after the error actually occurs, thus jeopardizing timing guarantees, which are as critical as functional ones in hard real-time systems. In this paper, we analyze the timing behavior of errors due to transient and permanent faults in light-lockstep systems. Our results show that the time elapsed until an error is detected can be inordinately large, especially for permanent faults. Based on this observation and building upon the specific characteristics of light-lockstep systems, we propose lightly verbose (LiVe), a new mechanism to enforce the early detection of errors, due to both transient and permanent faults, thus enabling the computation of tight error detection timing bounds. We also analyze how existing mechanisms for error recovery in multicore systems increase their effectiveness when light-lockstep operates in LiVe mode in the context of mixed-criticality workloads.},

To cope with this challenge, safety-critical systems industry is demanding new tools and methodologies allowing quick and cost-effective means for robustness verification. Microarchitectural simulators have been widely used to test reliability properties in different domains but their use in the process of robustness verification remains yet to be validated against other accepted methods such as RTL or gate-level simulation. In this paper we perform fault injections in an RTL model of a processor to characterize fault propagation. The results and conclusions of this characterization will serve to devise to what extent fault injection methodologies for robustness verification using microarchitectural simulators can be employed.},

In the limit, the objective is to provide fault tolerance transparently to the application. TFT, the work presented in this paper, provides transparent fault-tolerance at a higher interface than prior solutions. TFT coordinates replicas at the system call interface, interposing a supervisor agent between the application and the operating system. Moving the replica coordination to this interface allows uncorrelated faults within the operating system and below to be tolerated and also admits the possibility of online operating system and hardware upgrades. To accomplish its task, TFT must enforce a deterministic computation above the system call interface. The potential sources of non-determinism addressed include non-deterministic system calls, delivery of asynchronous events, and the representation of operating system abstractions that differ between replicas.},

  abstract = {Fault-tolerant architectures based on physical replication of components are vulnerable to faults that cause the same effect in all replica. Short outages in a power supply shared by all replica are a prominent example for such common cause faults. For systems in which the provision of a replicated power supply would cause prohibitive efforts the identification of reliable countermeasures against these effects is vital to maintain the required dependability level. In this paper we propose several of such countermeasures, namely parity protection, voltage monitoring and time diversity of the replica. We perform extensive fault injection experiments on three fault-tolerant dual core processor designs, one FPGA based and two commercial ASICs. These experiments provide evidence for the vulnerability of a completely unprotected dual core solution, while time diversity and voltage monitoring in combination with increased timing margins turn out particularly effective for eliminating common cause effects.},

However the low Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) cost solution provided by commercial FPGAs must take into account the high sensitivity to electronic defects. Fault-tolerance schemes, which prevent their architectures from being defective during products life-time, can decrease the system computing power. Therefore, building such fault-tolerant system needs an analytical model to analyze the effect of fault mitigation schemes on the system performance. This paper presents an analytical approach for a fault-tolerant dynamic multi-processor system-on-a-chip (FT-DyMPSoC) which is able to resist to predominant fault in FPGAs - Single Event Upset. The analytical model is introduced to assess the performance, the reliability and the trade-off of a fault-tolerant MPSoC system. Several comparisons with classical fault-tolerance solutions to enhance our solution advantages are also given.},

In this case we verified the robustness of the SoC processing subsystem to the Single Event Upset through the usage of some hardware emulation platforms where the device RTL was mapped, properly instrumented to allow the modification of Flip-Flop status during application runtime, thus modeling the SEUs effects. The main novelty of our work is therefore the definition of a methodology to verify the robustness of a SoC to SEUs; additionally we show that the same methodology can be used also to perform thorough measurements of the SER masking effect on a System on Chip.},

  abstract = {Safety-critical applications are required today to meet more and more stringent standards than ever. In the need of reducing the costs associated with the certification step, early robustness evaluation can provide valuable information, as long as it is fast and accurate enough. Microarchitectural simulators have been employed for testing reliability properties in several domains in the past, but their use in the process of robustness verification of safety critical systems has not been validated yet, as opposed to RTL or gate-level simulations. In the present work, we propose a methodology to improve the accuracy of faultinjection results when targeting robustness verification, by using microarchitectural simulators and virtual prototypes for an early estimation of deviations with respect to the certification standards.},

  abstract = {Fault screeners are a new breed of fault identification technique that can probabilistically detect if a transient fault has affected the state of a processor. We demonstrate that fault screeners function because of two key characteristics. First, we show that much of the intermediate data generated by a program inherently falls within certain consistent bounds. Second, we observe that these bounds are often violated by the introduction of a fault. Thus, fault screeners can identify faults by directly watching for any data inconsistencies arising in an application's behavior. We present an idealized algorithm capable of identifying over 85\% of injected faults on the SpecInt suite and over 75\% overall. Further, in a realistic implementation on a simulated Pentium-III-like processor, about half of the errors due to injected faults are identified while still in speculative state. Errors detected this early can be eliminated by a pipeline flush. In this paper, we present several hardware-based versions of this screening algorithm and show that flushing the pipeline every time the hardware screener triggers reduces overall performance by less than 1\%},

Due to the huge number of possible error configurations in complex circuits, a random selection of a subset of potential errors is usual in practical experiments. The main limitation of such a selection is the confidence in the outcomes that is never quantified in the articles. This paper proposes an approach to quantify both the error on the presented results and the confidence on the presented interval. The computation of the required number of faults to inject in order to achieve a given confidence and error interval is also discussed.

  abstract = {SIFT (Software Implemented Fault Tolerance) is an ultrareliable computer for critical aircraft control applications that achieves fault tolerance by the replication of tasks among processing units. The main processing units are off-the-shelf minicomputers, with standard microcomputers serving as the interface to the I/O system. Fault isolation is achieved by using a specially designed redundant bus system to interconnect the proeessing units. Error detection and analysis and system reconfiguration are performed by software. Iterative tasks are redundantly executed, and the results of each iteration are voted upon before being used. Thus, any single failure in a processing unit or bus can be tolerated with triplication of tasks, and subsequent failures can be tolerated after reconfiguration. Independent execution by separate processors means that the processors need only be loosely synchronized, and a novel fault-tolerant synchronization method is described. The SIFT software is highly structured and is formally specified using the SRI-developed SPECIAL language. The correctness of SIFT is to be proved using a hierarchy of formal models. A Markov model is used both to analyze the reliability of the system and to serve as the formal requirement for the SIFT design. Axioms are given to characterize the high-level behavior of the system, from which a correctness statement has been proved. An engineering test version of SIFT is currently being built.},

Fault-tolerance and performance are often contrasting requirements. Techniques to improve robustness to hardware faults are based on replication of hardware and/or software. Conversely, techniques to improve performance are based on exploiting inherent parallelism of multiprocessor architectures. In this paper, we propose a technique that allows the user to trade-off parallelism with fault-tolerance in a multicore hardware architecture. Our technique is based on a combination of hardware mechanisms and real-time operating system mechanisms. In particular, we apply hierarchical scheduling techniques to efficiently support fault-tolerant, fault-silent and non-fault-tolerant tasks in the same system.},

  abstract = {The huge investment in the design and production of multicore processors may be put at risk because the emerging highly miniaturized but unreliable fabrication technologies will impose significant barriers to the life-long reliable operation of future chips. Extremely complex, massively parallel, multi-core processor chips fabricated in these technologies will become more vulnerable to: (a) environmental disturbances that produce transient (or soft) errors, (b) latent manufacturing defects as well as aging/wearout phenomena that produce permanent (or hard) errors, and (c) verification inefficiencies that allow important design bugs to escape in the system. In an effort to cope with these reliability threats, several research teams have recently proposed multicore processor architectures that provide low-cost dependability guarantees against hardware errors and design bugs. This paper focuses on dependable multicore processor architectures that integrate solutions for online error detection, diagnosis, recovery, and repair during field operation. It discusses taxonomy of representative approaches and presents a qualitative comparison based on: hardware cost, performance overhead, types of faults detected, and detection latency. It also describes in more detail three recently proposed effective architectural approaches: a software-anomaly detection technique (SWAT), a dynamic verification technique (Argus), and a core salvaging methodology.},

Time-lag duplexing incorporates time and component redundancy to provide for transient errors both easy error recovery and tolerance against errors in common irredundant components. As a result, minimum performance and cost penalties are incurred. In this paper the fault detection and recovery algorithm using time-lag duplexing is shown for both transient and permanent faults. We show the applicability of time-lag duplexing by developing a prototype Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) System in a Network Computing Environment. Faults are injected into this prototype to show the viability of this technique},

  abstract = {It is getting mandatory to comply with ISO26262 in the recent automotive development. The implementation of safety mechanism to detect faults is one of the keys in ISO26262. The fault prediction will make the automotive system more reliable. The SoC in this paper introduces two features: hardware built-in self-test (BIST) for safety mechanism supporting automotive safety integrity level (ASIL) B and killer-droop monitor for fault prediction. In addition, time slicing is introduced to the testing with hardware BIST during runtime so that each test session can be shorter than the required interrupt response time in the application. The killer-droop monitor can predict the voltage droop and stop the clock supply for a certain period of time to mitigate the droop for preventing delay faults on the SoC. The monitor samples the voltage based on time-to-digital converter at CPU operation clock and predicts the voltage from the history of sampled voltage. With that prediction feature, the minimum operation voltage can be improved by 50 mV at 2.02 GHz CPU operation, and the maximum frequency can be improved by 140 MHz under 0.82 V power supply in 16 nm process.},

This paper presents a new class of synchronous deterministic non-authenticated algorithms for reaching Byzantine agreement on data descending from other (fault-tolerant) devices.

A dual system bus combines two duplicated areas. After recovery from a fault, it is necessary to resynchronize the system, so the contents of the main memory must be copied from the normal CPU to the other CPU. The overhead for copying must be small, so that the normal CPU can still continue the application. They describe a fault recovery method especially for a memory copying method. When a memory access has occurred, the memory interface unit snoops the data and sends them to another CPU using the dual system bus. They measured copy time using the real machine and simulated the copy overhead under a heavy DMA load. They obtained a small overhead and small load dependency},

Our work narrows the gap between both topics. We thoroughly analyse how clock glitches affect a commercial low-cost processor by performing a large number of experiments on five devices. We observe that the effects of fault injection on two-stage pipeline devices are more complex than commonly reported in the literature. While injecting a fault is relatively easy, injecting an exploitable fault is hard. We further observe that the easiest to inject and reliable fault is to replace instructions, and that random faults do not occur. Finally we explain how typical fault attacks can be mounted on this device, and describe a new attack for which the fault injection is easy and the cryptanalysis trivial.},

  doi = {10.1109/DDECS.2009.5012118},
  abstract = {The principle of duplication and comparison has proven very efficient for error detection in processor cores, since it can be applied as a generic solution for making virtually any type of core fail safe. A weakness of this approach, however, is the potential for common cause faults: Faults affecting both cores in the same way will escape detection. Shared resources and signals are especially prone to such effects. In practice the efforts for providing a redundant power source are often prohibitive, thus rendering the power supply such a shared resource. While a complete failure of the supply voltage can be relatively easily accommodated in a fail safe system, short pulses can have subtle consequences and are therefore much more dangerous. In this paper we will perform an experimental study of the potential of such power supply induced faults to create common cause effects. For this purpose we first study their effects on the operation of a processor core. In particular we will show that, when applied with the most adverse parameters, they tend to cause timing violations in the critical path. In two instances of the same core there is therefore a non-negligible risk of common cause effects. We will quantitatively assess this risk through fault injection experiments into an FPGA based dual core design.},

  abstract = {Today's vehicles contain a number of safety-critical systems designed to help improve overall vehicle safety. Such systems may control vital vehicle functions such as steering, braking and/or propulsion independently of the driver. In today's vehicles, much emphasis has been placed on helping ensure that these safety-critical vehicle systems operate as intended. Applying rigorous system safety engineering principles in developing these safety-critical automotive systems helps ensure that they operate as desired and expected. Less emphasis has been placed to-date on helping ensure cybersecurity of cyber-physical automotive systems. However, this is changing as both the world and the automotive industry become more aware of the potential ramifications of cyber-attacks on vehicles.As with system safety, applying a rigorous system security engineering process to the development of cyber-physical automotive systems is beneficial and will help reduce the likelihood of successful attacks on vehicles. System security and system safety interact with one another and cannot be considered in isolation. However, there are also differences between system security and system safety that require unique engineering activities to be performed to address these unique aspects. This paper describes some of the differences and similarities between system security and system safety, between safety-critical systems and security-critical systems, and between system safety and system security engineering, and presents a system security engineering process for applying to cyber-physical automotive systems that is based on the ISO 26262 process framework.},

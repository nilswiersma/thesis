The automotive industry increasingly relies on microcontrollers to perform critical operations through software, replacing classical solutions that rely just on mechanics or hardware. While safety is extensively covered, security is not. This thesis will focus on the security of these microprocessors by utilizing Fault Injection attacks. In order to do so, we will present the current state of the art in this regard. Next, we will evaluate a selection of different microprocessors to see how they fare against Fault Injection attacks. Finally we will present the results of this evaluation and also present some counter measures against the exploits presented.
